# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-29

Tonight? ("the Service") is designed as a quiet space for people such as romantic partners, spouses, roommates, or close friends to share promises and exchange signals. We handle personal data with the minimum scope necessary to operate the experience.

## 1. Information We Collect

We gather and process only the data required to provide the Service. Any future changes will be reflected in this document.

- Account identifiers (Firebase UID, pair ID, authentication tokens)
- Pairing details (6-digit codes, mutual confirmation results)
- Records related to Tonight? handshakes and Promise Cards
- Device context (OS, app version, notification token)
- Billing status (plan type, purchase or cancellation status)
- Diagnostics (crash reports, aggregated usage analytics)

## 2. How We Use the Information

- Delivering and operating the Service
- Processing subscriptions and verifying eligibility
- Responding to enquiries and providing support
- Preventing fraud and protecting security
- Complying with legal obligations or governmental requests

## 3. Sharing with Third Parties

Details of outbound data flows and third-party processors are documented in the "Outbound Data & Third-Party Sharing Policy." We never sell personal information without consent.

## 4. Retention

We store personal data only for as long as needed. When a pair is dissolved, their associated records are deleted. Information that must be retained under law is handled accordingly.

## 5. Your Rights

- Access, correct, or delete stored data
- Withdraw consent to processing
- Opt out from analytics and crash reporting

Please contact us via the in-app "Support" entry and we will assist you.

## 6. Security Measures

We apply transport encryption, access controls, and log monitoring to keep data safe. If a major incident occurs, we will notify affected users and share remediation steps.

## 7. International Transfers

Some infrastructure is hosted outside of your jurisdiction. We ensure the same level of protection by relying on appropriate safeguards and contractual clauses.

## 8. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

The Service can be used by people of all ages. If you are under 18, please consult a parent or guardian when using the Service.

## 9. Updates

We will announce material updates inside the app and on this page. Significant changes may also be communicated by email or push notification.
